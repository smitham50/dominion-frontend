## Dominion

You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your motherâ€™s side, would be delighted.


### Goal

This is a game of building a deck of cards. The deck is your Dominion. It contains your resources, victory points, and the things you can do. It starts out a small sad collection of Estates and Coppers, but you hope by the end of the game it will be brimming with Gold, Provinces, and the inhabitants and structures of your castle and kingdom.
The player with the most victory points in his Deck at game end wins.

### Card Types

#### Treasure cards:

With each treasure card you play from your hand, your wallet will be updated according to the treasure card's value. Treasure cards cannot be saved between turns, your wallet will reset to 0 at the end of your turn and any unused treasure cards will be discarded.

#### Victory cards:

Victory cards only serve one purpose, to give you victory points. You want as many of them as possible, but they also don't do anything until the end of the game, so if you buy too many too soon, you may wind up with turns where you have nothing but victory cards in your hand.

#### Action cards:

Action cards expand the possibilities of what you can accomplish in a turn. Each card has its own unique abilities. They can make it possible to play further action cards, draw additional cards into your hand, or buy more cards per turn. They can also add money to your wallet, attack your opponent, defend against your opponent, or permanently remove unwanted cards from your deck.

### Play Areas
#### Supply Area:

These are the cards you can purchase during your turn if you have any remaining buys and enough money in your wallet. Each card you buy will be added to your discard pile and ultimately reshuffled into your deck when you run out of cards to draw. The card costs are on the bottom left corner of each card, but you can also see them in the information area if you hover the mouse over a card.

#### Player Areas:

Each player has their own area containing their deck, discard and hand. Your hand cards will be exposed during your turn and hidden during your opponent's.

#### Player Info:

At the left and right sides of the screen you can see information about each player, including the number of actions, buys, the amount of money they have in their wallet on their turn, and their total victory points (VPs). These numbers can change during your turn but reset to 1 action, 1 buy and 0 wallet when you end your turn. The player info area also has a button to end your turn, and will occasionally display prompts to player further action is required.
